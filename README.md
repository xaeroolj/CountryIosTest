Countries
 
Develop two screens:
1. The first screen contains a text field and a list of countries. A user types search parameters in the text field to find a country and get the result of the search in the list. Every item in the list has a country name and country code. When the user taps on an element from the list he can see a detailed page about the selected country.
2. The second screen shows at least the flag, country name (with the native view), languages (with the native view), currencies and borders. When the user taps on one of the borders he can see the same detailed information about this border.
To get the data about countries please use free API - https://restcountries.eu
The project must have automatic tests.
